I have created a very simple and scalable system using angularjs and bootstrap for styling. 

Functional:

1 Dynamic D3.js Chart
2 Page Routing
3 LocalStorage
	3.1 Used to store/retrieve the data
	3.2 Any time later, Localstorage could be replaced with server rest apis.
4 Form validation



Any special instructions to running your code?

1 Go to the src folder in command line and run following commands
2 npm install
3 bower install
4 grunt
